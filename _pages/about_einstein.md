I have studied formal verification of neural network and Artificial Intelligence (AI) security. My research is centered on formalizing the black box properties of AI models to ensure its correct and sound behaviors. I am also interested in programming language (formal verification, program synthesis, compiler optimization), constraint programming, fairness in machine learning, and cyber security for reliable and secure software.
