The scale of investment in the AI industry is astronomical, yet interest in the security of AI models is significantly lacking in comparison.

My research is centered on formalizing the black box properties of artificial intelligence (AI) models to ensure its correct and sound behaviors. To achieve these goals, I am actively engaged in studying formal verification of neural networks and AI security.

I am also interested in programming language (formal verification, program synthesis, program repair, compiler optimization), deep learning verification, and cyber security for reliable and secure software.

I earned a Master's degree in Computer Science at University of California, Davis advised by [Prof. Ian Davidson](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~davidson/). Under supervision of Prof. Davidson, I studied deep fair clustering and constraints programing building on my previous experience. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Dongguk University. [Prof. Yunsik Son](https://sites.google.com/dgu.ac.kr/plass/english?authuser=0) opened my eyes to programming language, secure software and related research area.

In my free time, I usually [<u>cook</u>](/cooking/) or watch movies.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
