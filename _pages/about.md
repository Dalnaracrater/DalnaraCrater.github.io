My research goal is to verify programs and develop reliable and secure software with provable solutions through AI-based program synthesis and formal verification.

I am interested in programming language (formal verification, program synthesis, program repair, compiler optimization), deep learning verification, and cyber security for reliable and secure software.

I earned a Master's degree in Computer Science at University of California, Davis advised by [Prof. Ian Davidson](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~davidson/). Under supervision of Prof. Davidson, I studied deep fair clustering and constraints programing building on my previous experience. I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Dongguk University. [Prof. Yunsik Son](https://sites.google.com/dgu.ac.kr/plass/english?authuser=0) opened my eyes to programming language and related research area.

In my free time, I usually [<u>cook</u>](/cooking/) or watch movies.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
